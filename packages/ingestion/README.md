# @publisheriq/ingestion

TypeScript workers and API clients for Steam ingestion, sync scheduling, and change intelligence.

**Last Updated:** April 2026

## Overview

This package provides:

- Steam, SteamSpy, reviews, storefront, CCU, and embedding clients
- scheduled sync workers for metadata and metrics
- the change-intelligence queue worker, hint seeding worker, and news hot-refresh paths
- repair and backfill scripts for review truth, CCU quality, storefront authority, and change-intel projections
- rate limiting, retry, and change-intel support utilities
- source-side preparation for TigerData refresh flows via the `@publisheriq/data-plane` package

## Change Intelligence

The change-intelligence runtime is split across two TypeScript workers plus the PICS service:

- `app-change-hints` reads Steam app list hints and seeds capture work when the hint cursor changes.
- `change-intel-worker` drains `app_capture_work_state` for `storefront`, `news`, `projection_refresh`, and `hero_asset`, including bounded news catch-up and hot-refresh paths.
- `services/pics-service` writes normalized PICS history snapshots and PICS diff events before latest-state upserts.

### Operational Notes

- Storefront and news queue work is requeued automatically when stale claims are detected.
- Canonical diffing normalizes JSON payloads before comparing them, which reduces false positives caused by key ordering.
- Storefront remains authoritative for parsed `release_date` and `is_free`; PICS is enrichment/fallback data.
- Recent news search projections and latest projections keep chat/news queries fast without depending on the legacy projection path.

## TigerData Refresh Workflows

TigerData refresh and parity workflows are not run from this package, but they are part of the same overall data pipeline:

- bootstrap SQL lives in `packages/data-plane/sql/tiger-bootstrap/`
- backfill and reconcile scripts live in `packages/data-plane/src/scripts/`
- scheduled Tiger syncs are triggered from GitHub Actions using the same package-level contract assumptions

The ingestion workers continue to own the live source side of the pipeline. TigerData owns the query-serving slice.
The separate `@publisheriq/youtube` package owns YouTube collection and rollup
work for the shipped YouTube chat contract family.

`pnpm --filter @publisheriq/ingestion refresh-views` refreshes the heavyweight materialized-view chain only. `app_filter_data` and the Games page filter-count views are scheduled separately.

## Railway Worker Deployment

The production `change-intel-*` Railway services should use the dedicated worker
config at `/packages/ingestion/railway.json`.

- Keep the Railway service root directory at `/` so the worker build can see the
  workspace packages it imports from.
- Keep the start command as `pnpm --filter @publisheriq/ingestion change-intel-worker`.
- Do not attach the repo-root `/railway.toml` to these services. That file is
  reserved for `query-api`.
- Do not add an HTTP healthcheck to these workers. They are background queue
  processors, not web services.

### Important Environment Variables

```bash
CLAIM_LIMIT=25
POLL_INTERVAL_MS=5000
QUEUE_SOURCES=storefront,news,projection_refresh,hero_asset
NEWS_CATCHUP_SEED_LIMIT=0
MAX_IDLE_POLLS=0
CLAIM_STALE_AFTER_MS=1800000
STALE_CLAIM_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS=60000
```

Keep `NEWS_CATCHUP_SEED_LIMIT=0` for continuously scheduled hot-refresh workers.
Set a positive value only for intentional catch-up runs.

## Other Useful Environment Variables

```bash
BATCH_SIZE=500
MAX_PAGES=0
CCU_DAILY_LIMIT=150000
SYNC_COLLECTION=all
INTERPOLATION_DAYS=30
INTERPOLATION_APP_BATCH_SIZE=2000
```

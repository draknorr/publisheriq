# PublisherIQ

Steam analytics platform for browsing games and companies, tracking change intelligence, and querying the warehouse through an AI chat interface.

## Current Highlights

- **Change Feed** at `/changes` for grouped storefront, PICS, media, and news activity
- **Games + Companies analytics** with advanced filters, saved views, compare, and export
- **Insights dashboard** for top games, newest releases, and personalized monitoring
- **AI chat** backed by Cube.js, Qdrant, and streaming responses
- **OTP-first auth** with waitlist approval, `?next=` redirects, and hardened callback handling
- **Change-intelligence runtime** across TypeScript workers, SQL read surfaces, and the PICS service

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm --filter @publisheriq/admin dev
```

The dashboard runs on `http://localhost:3001`.

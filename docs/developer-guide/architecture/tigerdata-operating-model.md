# TigerData Operating Model

This document is the current source of truth for how PublisherIQ uses **TigerData (Timescale)** alongside Supabase and Cube.

**Last Updated:** April 6, 2026

## Summary

PublisherIQ is currently a **split-serving system**:

- **Supabase** remains the write authority and control plane.
- **TigerData** serves the contract-backed read plane through `apps/query-api`.
- **Cube.js** remains available for compatibility and legacy analytics reads that have not yet moved to typed contracts.

This is the live operating model today. It is not a future-state memo and it is not a full Supabase exit.

## Topology

### Production / Preview Shape

```text
Vercel Preview      -> Railway Preview query-api      -> Tiger Preview
Vercel Production   -> Railway Production query-api   -> Tiger Production

Shared write/control path:
Workers + PICS service -> Supabase
Supabase -> Tiger refresh workflows -> Tiger targets
```

### Local Shape

```text
Local admin app      -> local query-api on 127.0.0.1:4318 -> TigerData target
Workers / scripts    -> Supabase live source by default
Tiger scripts        -> Supabase source + Tiger target
```

Local admin development can default to `http://127.0.0.1:4318` if `QUERY_API_BASE_URL` is unset. Deployed Vercel preview and production environments must set an explicit HTTPS `QUERY_API_BASE_URL`.

## What Lives In TigerData Today

TigerData is not a generic mirror of the full Supabase database. It contains the read slices needed for contract-backed chat and discovery.

### Primary TigerData schema groups

| Schema    | Purpose                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`    | entities and identity-backed cross-entity read models                     |
| `metrics` | time-series history, especially `metrics.daily_metrics`                   |
| `events`  | app change event history                                                  |
| `docs`    | news items and search projections                                         |
| `ops`     | operational metadata needed by data-plane flows                           |
| `chat`    | contract-serving or chat-oriented helper relations                        |
| `legacy`  | compatibility landing zone for slices still shaped like the old warehouse |

### Contract-serving relation categories

- entity resolution and current-overview relations
- catalog search relations
- momentum and ranking relations
- semantic retrieval inputs and embeddings
- change/news event and search relations
- user-context relations for pins and alerts

## Current Contract Surface

The live contract registry in `packages/data-plane/src/contract-registry.ts` currently marks all of these as `ready`:

- `resolveEntities`
- `getEntityOverview`
- `getRelatedEntities`
- `searchCatalog`
- `discoverMomentum`
- `searchChangeActivity`
- `discoverChangePatterns`
- `rankEntities`
- `compareEntities`
- `traceMetricHistory`
- `explainChanges`
- `searchDocuments`
- `semanticSearch`
- `getUserContext`
- `continueResultSet`

These are served by `apps/query-api`. The admin app should consume them through HTTP, not by connecting directly to TigerData.

## Data Movement and Refresh Path

### 1. Ingest and normalize into Supabase

Workers and services write into Supabase first:

- catalog and metadata sync
- reviews, histograms, CCU, and derived metrics
- change-intel events and projections
- auth, user data, credits, pins, alerts, and logs
- PICS latest-state enrichment and PICS history capture

### 2. Bootstrap TigerData

Initial target setup uses ordered bootstrap SQL from `packages/data-plane/sql/tiger-bootstrap/`.

The key phases are:

1. extensions and schemas
2. core identity
3. legacy compatibility
4. taxonomy and relationship context
5. feature and user context
6. metrics daily history
7. events and news
8. events/news performance delta
9. core identity seed

### 3. Backfill TigerData from the live source

The primary backfill flow is:

1. legacy compatibility slice
2. daily metrics slice
3. events/news slice
4. reconcile
5. validate

### 4. Keep TigerData current

Scheduled GitHub Actions refresh selected TigerData slices from Supabase:

- production Tiger refresh runs daily
- preview Tiger refresh is manual
- reconcile and validate artifacts are uploaded for inspection

## Events / News Parity Expectations

The TigerData change/news slice is only considered ready when reconcile and validate runs stay green.

Important parity expectations:

- `docs.steam_news_items` matches the source
- `events.app_change_events` matches the source
- `docs.steam_news_search_projection` matches the source
- duplicate event IDs remain zero
- orphaned or projection-missing news rows remain zero

The scheduled production and preview sync workflows start with
`recent_window` projection repair by default so normal runs only chase the
trailing projection window. When the initial reconcile fails only because
`app_change_events` still has count-only drift, the workflow automatically
retries one bounded `app_change_events` reconcile/validate pass. When the
initial reconcile fails only because `docs.steam_news_search_projection` still
has historical month drift, the workflow automatically reruns a projection-only
`exact_parity` reconcile before the final validate step. Operators can still
select `projection_repair_scope=exact_parity` to force that historical repair
on the first reconcile pass, and can use the preview-only
`tiger-preview-events-news.yml` workflow for faster events/news recovery
verification without legacy or metrics backfills. When the goal is only to
confirm the classifier and routing logic, `stop_after_classification=true`
turns that preview workflow into a smoke test that skips retries, fallback, and
the final validate pass.

The exact-parity milestone note remains historical documentation, but the current operational expectation is that these validations continue to gate trust in the Tiger-backed document and change contracts.

## Environment Boundaries

### Admin / Vercel

Important environment variables:

- `QUERY_API_BASE_URL`
- `QUERY_API_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `CHAT_TIGER_PRIMARY_MODE`
- `CHAT_TIGER_SHADOW_MODE`
- `CHAT_TIGER_LEGACY_FALLBACK_ENABLED`

### Query API / Data Plane

Important environment variables:

- `TIGER_PRIMARY_URL`
- `DATA_PLANE_SOURCE_URL`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DATA_PLANE_MAX_POOL_SIZE`
- `DATA_PLANE_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `QUERY_API_BEARER_TOKEN`

### Principle

- `TIGER_PRIMARY_URL` points at the TigerData target.
- `DATA_PLANE_SOURCE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL` represent the live source for bootstrap, backfill, and local fallback cases.
- The admin app never needs `TIGER_PRIMARY_URL` directly.

## Operational Checks

### Query API

Verify:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- authenticated `GET /v1/contracts`

Expected result:

- source reports `tiger`

### Tiger refresh workflows

Verify:

- workflow success
- uploaded manifest artifacts
- reconcile / validate outputs

### Admin-side debugging

When chat results look wrong, inspect:

- query details in `/chat`
- admin chat logs
- execution traces
- contract summaries
- query-api health and readiness

## What TigerData Does Not Own Yet

TigerData does **not** currently replace Supabase for:

- product-page reads for `/apps`, `/companies`, `/changes`, `/admin`
- auth and user/session state
- credits and chat logs
- general warehouse writes

TigerData should therefore be described as the **contract-serving read plane**, not the universal product database.

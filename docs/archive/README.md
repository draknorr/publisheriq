## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during the initial development and contain valuable historical context. However, they have been replaced by the current documentation structure:

- **Implementation plans** → Now reflected in current codebase state
- **Architecture overviews** → Consolidated in [/docs/architecture/](../architecture/)
- **API references** → Updated in [/docs/reference/](../reference/)
- **Troubleshooting notes** → Moved to [/docs/guides/troubleshooting.md](../guides/troubleshooting.md)

## Using Archived Docs

These documents may still be useful for:
- Understanding original design decisions
- Historical context for why things were built a certain way
- Reference for API response formats and data structures
- Debugging edge cases documented during development

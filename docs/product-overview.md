| Histogram Sync | Weekly | Full catalog | 15-30 min |
| Trends Calculation | Daily 04:30 UTC | All apps | 5-10 min |
| Priority Calculation | Daily 04:45 UTC | All apps | 5-10 min |

#### Priority-Based Scheduling

Games are assigned to refresh tiers based on a scoring algorithm:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| CCU 10,000+ | 100 |
| CCU 1,000+ | 50 |
| CCU 100+ | 25 |
| 10+ reviews/day | 40 |
| Trend change detected | 10% |
| Dead game penalty | -50 |
| Never-synced | 25 (base) |

Tiers determine sync frequency: Active (6-12h), Moderate (24-48h), Dormant (weekly), Dead (monthly).

#### Velocity-Based Review Sync

Reviews are synced at intervals determined by review velocity:

| Tier | Reviews/Day | Sync Interval |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| High | >= 5 | 4 hours |
| Medium | 1-5 | 12 hours |
| Low | 0.1-1 | 24 hours |

| Tier 3 | All other games | 3x daily (rotation) | ~120,000 |

Tier 3 uses rotation tracking (`last_ccu_synced`) with oldest-first ordering to achieve full catalog coverage every ~2 days. Invalid app IDs are automatically skipped for 30 days to reduce wasted API calls.

### 4.2 Computed Insight Metrics

Six novel metrics provide deeper analytical value:

| Metric | Formula | Insight |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Momentum Score** | (CCU Growth 7d + Velocity Acceleration) / 2 | Combined signal: "Is this game taking off?" |
| **Sentiment Delta** | Current positive % - Previous positive % | Catch comeback stories and review bombs |
| **Active Player %** | (Peak CCU / Owners) x 100 | Engagement depth vs historical reach |
| **Review Rate** | (Reviews / Owners) x 1,000 | Community engagement level |
| **Value Score** | Avg Playtime (hours) / Price (dollars) | Entertainment per dollar (excludes free games) |
| **vs Publisher Avg** | Game Score - Publisher Avg Score | Performance relative to publisher's catalog |

#### Momentum Score Indicators

| Score | Indicator | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| >= 20 | Double rocket | Very strong momentum |
| 10-19 | Rocket | Strong momentum |
| 0-9 | Up-right arrow | Moderate positive |
| -9 to 0 | Right arrow | Stable |
| -19 to -10 | Down-right arrow | Declining |
| <= -20 | Chart down | Significant decline |

#### Sentiment Delta Indicators

| Change | Label |
|--------|-------|
| >= +10% | Surging |
| +3% to +9% | Improving |
| -3% to +3% | Stable |
| -9% to -3% | Declining |
| <= -10% | Review Bomb |

### 4.3 Publisher & Developer Aggregates

Publishers and developers have portfolio-level metrics computed via materialized views:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Game Count | Total games published/developed |
| Total Owners | Sum of owner estimates across all games |
| Total Reviews | Sum of reviews across all games |
| Avg Review Score | Average positive percentage across games |
| Peak CCU | Highest CCU across all games |
| Est. Weekly Hours | Sum of estimated weekly played hours |
| Est. Gross Revenue | Sum of estimated revenue across games |
| CCU Growth 7d/30d (%) | Portfolio-level growth calculations |
| Review Velocity | Portfolio-level review rate |

**Materialized Views Used**: `publisher_metrics`, `developer_metrics`, `publisher_year_metrics`, `developer_year_metrics`, `publisher_game_metrics`, `developer_game_metrics`

### 4.4 Velocity Tiers & Trend Detection

#### Velocity Tiers

Games are classified by review activity:

| Tier | Reviews/Day | Proportion |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| High | >= 5 | ~1% of active games |
| Medium | 1-5 | ~5% |
| Low | 0.1-1 | ~15% |
| Dormant | < 0.1 | ~79% |

#### Trend Calculation

- **30-day analysis**: Compare current 30-day metrics to prior 30-day period
- **90-day analysis**: Longer-term trend confirmation
- **Stability threshold**: 2% change required to register a trend direction change
- **Velocity trend**: Accelerating (7d > 30d x 1.2), Decelerating (7d < 30d x 0.8), Stable (otherwise)

#### Trend Discovery (Chat)

The `discover_trending` tool supports four discovery modes:
- **review_momentum**: Highest review activity (most reviews/day)
- **accelerating**: Games where review rate is increasing
- **breaking_out**: Hidden gems gaining attention (accelerating + 100-10K reviews)
- **declining**: Games losing momentum

### 4.5 Estimated Weekly Played Hours

A novel engagement metric available at game, publisher, and developer levels:

**Formula**: SUM(7-day CCU) x (avg_playtime_2weeks / 2 / 60)

**Example**: A game with 50,000 total CCU over 7 days and 120 min avg playtime in 2 weeks = 50,000 x (120 / 2 / 60) = 50,000 hours

Available via Cube.js cubes: `MonthlyGameMetrics`, `MonthlyPublisherMetrics`

**Caveats**: This is an estimation based on CCU and average playtime data. Actual played hours may vary.

## 6. Performance & Reliability

### 6.1 Query Performance

| Operation | Fast Path | Slow Path | Trigger for Slow Path |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Games page load | ~200ms | ~4s | vs_publisher filter/sort or relationship filters |
| Companies page load | ~214ms | ~4s | Growth/relationship filters |
| Filter counts | <10ms | ~4s | Non-default filters |
| Aggregate stats | <10ms | ~4s | Complex filter combinations |
| Sparkline data | <100ms | - | Always fast (RPC) |
| Chat response | 500-2000ms LLM + tools | - | Depends on tool complexity |

### 6.2 Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Two-path query strategy | 20x faster for default views |
| Pre-computed content arrays (GIN-indexed) | Content filtering: seconds to milliseconds |
| Pre-computed aggregate stats (MVs) | Summary stats: timeout to <10ms |
| Lazy-loaded sparklines (IntersectionObserver) | Only fetches visible rows |
| Batch sparkline fetching | Single RPC for visible rows |
| 5-minute filter count caching | Eliminates redundant queries |
| URL-first state management | Avoids React state serialization overhead |
| 400ms debounced filter updates | Batches rapid changes |
| Trigram indexes | Fast ILIKE text search on names |
| Covering indexes | Sort optimization without table lookups |

### 6.3 Rate Limits

| API | Limit |
|-----|-------|
| Steam App List | 100,000 requests/day |
| Steam Storefront | ~200 requests/5 min |
| Steam Reviews | 60 requests/min (1 req/sec) |
| Steam CCU | 1 request/sec |
| SteamSpy (bulk) | 1 request/60 sec |
| SteamSpy (detail) | 1 request/sec |
| Chat API | 10 req/min, 100 req/hour per user |

### 6.4 Error Handling & Resilience

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Rate limit retry | Token bucket algorithm with exponential backoff (1s -> 2s -> 4s, max 10s) |
| API retry | 3 retries for retryable errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) |
| Circuit breaker | Stops requests after consecutive failures |
| Job tracking | All sync operations logged in `sync_jobs` table with status/timing |
| Credit reservation | Reserve-then-finalize pattern with automatic refund on failure |
| CCU skip tracking | Invalid app IDs skipped for 30 days |
| Graceful degradation | SteamSpy supplementary fetch fills gaps in pagination |
| Data interpolation | Linear interpolation fills gaps in review time-series data |

## 7. Security

### 7.1 Authentication & Access Control

- **OTP authentication** with 8-digit codes, 10-minute expiry, rate-limited (3 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Invite-only access** via waitlist with admin approval
- **Role-based access**: User and Admin roles
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** on all user-facing tables
- **Session-based cookies** with secure configuration

### 7.2 Vulnerabilities Patched (v2.8)

14 security vulnerabilities addressed in a dedicated security release:

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Critical | 4 | Privilege escalation via RLS policy, SECURITY DEFINER function exposure, dev bypass risk, public chat log access |
| High | 3 | Open redirect, missing route-level auth, host header injection |
| Medium | 3 | Redirect parameter mismatch, inefficient user lookup, inconsistent client patterns |

### 7.3 Data Security

- **Read-only chat queries**: All SQL executed via chat is read-only with keyword blocking
- **Credit reservation pattern**: Prevents usage without sufficient credits
- **Column-level UPDATE grants**: Prevent users from modifying role or credit fields
- **Auth validation in SECURITY DEFINER functions**: All sensitive functions validate `auth.uid()`
- **Admin-only access**: Chat query logs, user management, sync controls restricted to admin role
- **No credentials in exports**: Export functionality excludes sensitive internal data

### 7.4 Redirect Security

- Allowlist validation for redirect URLs
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable prevents host header injection
- Standardized redirect parameter handling

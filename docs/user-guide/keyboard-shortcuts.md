## Modal Dialogs

All modal dialogs share these behaviors:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **`Escape`** | Close the dialog |
| **Click outside** | Close the dialog |

**Dialogs affected:**
- Global search
- Compare mode
- Export dialog
- Column customizer
- Filter dropdowns
- Saved views menu

## Focus Management

When modals open, focus is automatically moved to an appropriate element:
- **Search dialog**: Focus moves to search input
- **Compare mode**: Focus moves to close button
- **Export dialog**: Focus moves to close button

This ensures keyboard-only users can immediately interact with the modal content.

## Tips

### Quick Navigation
Press **`⌘K`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl+K`** (Windows/Linux) to instantly open search from anywhere. Type a game, publisher, or developer name and press **Enter** to navigate directly.

### Batch Selection
On data table pages, hold **Shift** and click to select a range of items. Combined with bulk actions, this makes it easy to compare or export multiple items quickly.

### Escape to Dismiss
**Escape** is your universal "go back" or "cancel" key. It closes any open modal, dropdown, or overlay.

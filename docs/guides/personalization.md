## How Alerts Work

### Alert Types

| Type | Trigger | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **CCU Spike** | +50% above 7-day average | Significant increase in concurrent players |
| **CCU Drop** | -50% below 7-day average | Significant decrease in concurrent players |
| **Trend Reversal** | Direction changed | 30-day trend flipped from up to down or vice versa |
| **Review Surge** | 3x normal velocity | Unusually high review activity |
| **Sentiment Shift** | +/-5% change | Positive review ratio changed significantly |
| **Price Change** | Any change | Price or discount percentage changed |
| **New Release** | Publisher/developer ships game | A pinned publisher or developer released a new title |
| **Milestone** | Review count threshold | Crossed 10K, 50K, 100K, 500K, or 1M reviews |

### When Alerts Are Generated

- **Hourly**: CCU anomalies, trend reversals, review surges, sentiment shifts, milestones
- **Real-time**: Price changes (via database trigger)
- **Real-time**: New releases from pinned publishers/developers (via database trigger)

### Severity Levels

| Level | Visual Indicator | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **High** | Red left border | CCU spike >100%, discount >50%, 100K+ milestone |
| **Medium** | Yellow left border | Standard threshold breaches |
| **Low** | Subtle border | Minor price changes |

### Alert Deduplication

To prevent spam, each alert type can only fire once per day per entity per user. If a condition persists, you'll receive a new alert the next day.

### Viewing and Dismissing Alerts

- **View**: Click an alert to navigate to the entity and mark it as read
- **Dismiss**: Hover over an alert and click the X button to remove it
- **Badge**: The bell icon in the sidebar shows your unread alert count

---

## Configuring Preferences

### Accessing Preferences

1. Go to **Insights** > **My Dashboard**
2. Click the **gear icon** next to "Recent Alerts"

### Global Toggle

**Enable Alerts** - Master switch to turn all alerts on or off.

### Alert Type Toggles

Enable or disable specific alert types:

- CCU Spikes
- CCU Drops
- Trend Reversals
- Review Surges
- Sentiment Shifts
- Price Changes
- New Releases
- Milestones

### Sensitivity Sliders

Adjust how sensitive the detection is for certain alert types:

| Setting | Range | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **CCU Changes** | 0.5x - 2.0x | Lower = fewer alerts, Higher = more alerts |
| **Review Surges** | 0.5x - 2.0x | Lower = fewer alerts, Higher = more alerts |
| **Sentiment Shifts** | 0.5x - 2.0x | Lower = fewer alerts, Higher = more alerts |

**How sensitivity works:**
- **0.5x (Less)**: Requires 2x the normal change to trigger an alert
- **1.0x (Default)**: Standard threshold behavior
- **2.0x (More)**: Triggers alerts on half the normal change

### Saving Preferences

Click **Save Changes** to apply your settings. Changes take effect immediately for new alerts.

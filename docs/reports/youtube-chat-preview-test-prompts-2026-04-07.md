# YouTube Chat Preview Test Prompts

As of 2026-04-07

Use these after:

1. running the preview mirror
2. running `pnpm --filter @publisheriq/youtube verify-preview-mirror`
3. confirming `CHAT_TIGER_YOUTUBE_ENABLED=true` in preview and `false` in production

These prompts are intentionally limited to the v1 surface that is now implemented behind the server-side flag.

- `What does the YouTube content mix look like for Resident Evil 2?`
- `How many new YouTube videos and distinct upload channels did Destiny 2 get in the last 7 days?`

## Format-Specific Cases

- `Show me the newest shorts for ARC Raiders on YouTube.`
- `Show me the latest live or recent live YouTube videos for Palworld.`
- `What are the biggest standard YouTube videos for Baldur's Gate 3 right now?`
